# Login System

This is a login system implemented with Node and Express. It allows the user to register with their information and then login. After the user is authenticated through logging in, a JWT access token is stored in their cookies that grants them authorization to the protected route.

## Installation

npm install

node server.js
## Usage/Examples

Go to http://localhost:3000/register and input all of your details. After submitting that information, you will be redirected to the login page where you will login.

If everything is successful, you will be redirected to the protected page.
